# Big Decimal

Implementation close to the equivalent of BigDecimal in Java, adapted for Dart.

## Objective

This project is intended to help the developer (especially those who came from other languages) to work with numbers in dart. The inspiration for this package, as the name suggests, came from java's BigDecimal class, so the intent is for the syntax to be as familiar as possible.
